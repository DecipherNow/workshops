# Multimesh workshop

This workshop covers multi-mesh configuration with Grey Matter. The workshop material can be found [here](./workshop.md).

## Requirements

- deployed EC2 instance
- Decipher quickstart certs
- Decipher Nexus login

### Deploying an EC2 instance

To get started you will need to deploy an AWS instance using the AMI `ami-03165df1bdcc06a0d`.

First, create a new security group with a TCP rule to allow traffic on port `30000` and enable SSH connections:

```sh
# Create group
aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name multimesh-workshop --description "Security group for Multimesh workshop"
# Add SSH
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name multimesh-workshop --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
# Add mesh ingress
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name multimesh-workshop --protocol tcp --port 30000 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

You'll also need to get the name of the key-pair you use to login to AWS ec2 instances. You can find this in your EC2 dashboard under NETWORK & SECURITY -> Key Pairs.
 
Using the security group ID returned from the first command and your key name, execute:

```sh
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-03165df1bdcc06a0d --count 1 --key-name <key-pair-name> --instance-type t2.large --security-group-ids <security-group-id>
```

Once the instance is up, you can start working through the [workshop material.](./workshop.md)

## Building the AMI

There is a build.json file in this repository that contains a [packer](https://packer.io) build configuration for the AMI.

To build, first [install packer](https://packer.io/intro/getting-started/install.html). Then run:

```sh
packer build ./build.json
```

NOTE: It is not necessary (or advised) to build the AMI if you're just trying to run the workshop. You should just need to follow the instructions in [Deploying an EC2 instance.](#deploying-an-ec2-instance)
